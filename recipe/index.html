	<h2>Welcome to Shurong's webpage </h2>

	<p>Hello, I'm not a good cook yet I simply love cooking.<br></br>
	During the Covid-19 period, I learn to make some really simple home cooked foods.<br></br>
	Thanks to my beloved mother for sharing her cooking experiences and tips with me. <br></br>
	I'm happy to share <a href="recipe.html"> My Mother's Recipe </a> to anyone interested to make simple meals. </p>
